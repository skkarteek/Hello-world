BOOTCAMP
============
A boot camp is much like a training camp where you learn / hone your skills. Bootcamp is preceeded by the Pre-Bootcamp assignments,for the purpose of getting to know the basics of the concepts that you have to work with during the Bootcamp period. Bootcamp covers various concepts related to Mickeylite, Saslite, Database, Data clusters, Application servers, starting a server in development and in production mode (with/without security enabled). A basic idea on the concepts are given, after which you will have to carry out tasks based on the said concepts.

PRE-BOOTCAMP
==============
Pre-Bootcamp helps to familiarize yourself with the basic mysql commands and how to start your local computer as a server using tomcat. In pre-bootcamp, the Structured Query Language(SQL) queries are executed through JavaServer Pages(JSP). The connection is achieved through Java Database Connection(JDBC). This is done in order for you to understand why you are moving from JDBC to Mickeylite and from Mickeylite to Saslite during the Bootcamp period.
